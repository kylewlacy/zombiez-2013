Zombiez: 2013
=============
An experimental simulation about surviving the zombie apocolypse.

Installation
------------
Running `chmod +x ./build_<platform>.sh` and `./build_<platform>.sh` will build the game. This is a temporary setup until I decide to add a Makefile to make this simpler. Currently only compiles and runs on OS X, but the code base will be mostly C\C++, so it should be relatively easy to port later on.
